🎓 EduJob: AI-Based Job Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

EduJob is an AI-powered job prediction system that analyzes student academic and skill-based data to predict the most suitable job roles.
It uses Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier) to recommend career paths based on user inputs like CGPA, skills, internships, and certifications.

🚀 Features
🔐 User Authentication
Registration & Login system using CSV storage
Email and password validation
📊 Interactive Dashboard
Displays dataset insights
Shows total students, job roles, and skills
🧠 AI-Based Prediction
Predicts Top 3 job roles with probability scores
Highlights best match
📈 Data Visualization
Job role distribution graph
Programming skill demand graph
📜 Prediction History
Stores and displays user prediction history
🧠 Machine Learning Model
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
Why Random Forest?
Handles categorical + numerical data well

Encoded categorical data using one-hot encoding
Label encoding for target variable
Output:
Top 3 predicted job roles with probability (%)
⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Python
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
streamlit
Storage:
CSV files (users, dataset, history)

📊 How It Works
User Input → Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Prediction → Output Display
User enters academic & skill details
Data is preprocessed (encoding applied)
Model predicts job role probabilities
Top 3 job roles are displayed
